# Synth Homework 1

In this Max patch, I created a simple synthesizer with the following features:

1. **Waveform selection:** The user can choose between four waveforms — sine, square, triangle, and sawtooth.  
2. **Harmonic generation:** The patch produces a chord by combining the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th harmonics of the fundamental frequency.  
3. **Frequency modulation:** FM can be applied to further shape the sound.  
4. **ADSR modulation:** The attack, decay, sustain, and release stages of the chord are adjustable for dynamic control.  
5. **Filtering:** A low-pass filter is used at the end of the signal chain to smooth out the overall output.
